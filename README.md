# School District Analysis 2021
### Overview of the School District Analysis

The purpose of the given analysis was to help a client fix errors in math reports that were brought to her atteention by the School Board that she answers to. Academic Dishonesty was found in Highschool Freshmen from a "Thomas High School" while analyzing data from multiple high schools. The task specifically called for not only a cleean-up of the Academic Dishonesty, but also a second analysis of the School District reviewed and analyzed for this project. 

## Results

- How is the District Summary affected?
The District Summary is most affected in regards to Thomas High School as a whole, but also to it's place in hierarchies in regards to items such as finances, student population, and overall scores.

With the comparisons above we can see that the affect of Academic Dishonesty in Thomas High School affected the Passing Math, Passing Reading, and Passing Overall percentages. Passing Math dropped from 74.9% to 74.8%; Passing Reading dropped from 85.8% to 85.7%; and Passing Overall dropped from 65.1% to 64.9%. While not the largest changes, this does illustrate that if Academic Dishonesty occured in multiple schools and was not attended to that percentages could quckly become skewed.

- How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading score affect Thomas High School's performance relativee to the other schools? How does it affect math and reading scores by grade, school spending, school size, and school type?

As shown in the above images, and especially in the School Summary, we can see that Thomas High School's performance goes from scores in the lower to upper 90s to scores sinking into the upper and mid 60s.
