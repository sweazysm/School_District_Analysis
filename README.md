With the comparisons above we can see that the affect of Academic Dishonesty in Thomas High School affected the Passing Math, Passing Reading, and Passing Overall percentages. Passing Math dropped from 74.9% to 74.8%; Passing Reading dropped from 85.8% to 85.7%; and Passing Overall dropped from 65.1% to 64.9%. While not the largest changes, this does illustrate that if Academic Dishonesty occured in multiple schools and was not attended to that percentages could quckly become skewed.
